<p>This project is set to make a text editor with educational purpose, i.e, to known how one generally works.
Besides its educational purpose, we want to make a fully functional editor, so we want:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ability to open, close, edit files; </li>
<li>Ability to work with different text encodings, to convert among them and to reasonably detect them;</li>
<li>Support to syntax highlight and section folding through some extension mechanism;</li>
<li>Support for text completion, also through some extension mechanism.</li>
<li>Ability to <em>scriptize</em> (through macro or something like that);</li>
</ul>

<p>We will focus on the inner working of the editor (their data structures and stuff like that), so our main 
artifact produced will mostly be a library. We also produce the lessons itself, explaining its particular focus.
Finally we will have at least one <em>reference implementation</em> editor, who implements the library into a somewhat
useful editor. </p>

<p>Each lesson is its own branch. Each lesson is build upon the last one, so you can always compare it with previous one.
The master branch can contain some unfinished work, so don't look for lessons there (You can of course look for the 
cutting edge code there).</p>
