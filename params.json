  "body": "SWEET (Sweet and Weird Educational EdiTor)\r\n==========================================\r\n\r\nThis project is set to make a text editor with educational purpose, i.e, to known how one generally works.\r\nBesides its educational purpose, we want to make a fully functional editor, so we want:\r\n\r\n- Ability to open, close, edit files; \r\n- Ability to work with different text encodings, to convert among them and to reasonably detect them;\r\n- Support to syntax highlight and section folding through some extension mechanism;\r\n- Support for text completion, also through some extension mechanism.\r\n- Ability to *scriptize* (through macro or something like that);\r\n\r\nWe will focus on the inner working of the editor (their data structures and stuff like that), so our main \r\nartifact produced will mostly be a library. We also produce the lessons itself, explaining its particular focus.\r\nFinally we will have at least one *reference implementation* editor, who implements the library into a somewhat\r\nuseful editor. \r\n\r\nDevelopment Strategy\r\n====================\r\n\r\nEach lesson is its own branch. Each lesson is build upon the last one, so you can always compare it with previous one.\r\nThe master branch can contain some unfinished work, so don't look for lessons there (You can of course look for the \r\ncutting edge code there).\r\n\r\nLessons\r\n=======\r\n\r\n1. [File Target](https://github.com/talesm/sweet/blob/lesson1/README.md);\r\n2. How to Inserting content;\r\n3. Lines? LINES!\r\n4. Encodings, a short guide.\r\n5. *To be defined*",
